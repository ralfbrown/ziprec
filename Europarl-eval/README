Due to its size and ready availability, the Europarl corpus has not
been included here.  Please retrieve it from
http://www.statmt.org/europarl/ .  You want the "source release (text
files)".

Tests were performed using Release v7 (15 May 2012), downloaded from
http://www.statmt.org/europarl/v7/europarl.tgz 


The following scripts are included:

   collect.sh	generates training and test files from the corpus
   mkmodels.sh	train language models from all training files
   eval.sh	run a single test-language/model-language evaluation
   eval-same.sh run eval for all languages using same test & model language
   eval-all.sh	run the complete cross-product of test and model languages
   score.sh	extract the performance statistics into tab-separated columns


The general work-flow for running performance evaluations is:
   uncompress and extract the corpus archive
   run collect.sh over the extracted corpus files
   run mkmodels.sh to train the language models for reconstruction
   run eval.sh/eval-all.sh to generate log files with performancs stats
   run score.sh to collect the performance stats into one file
   load the result of score.sh into a spreadsheet and generate pivot tables
