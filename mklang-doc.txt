MkLang - Make language data for ZipRecover reconstruction

The commandline syntax of MkLang is
	mklang [options] langfile trainingfile [trainingfile ...]

At least one training file must be specified.  These files should be
representative of the kind of text to be reconstructed by ZipRecover,
and should not be preprocessed in any way (text normalization will
skew the statistics needed by ZipRecover).  The resulting output file
'langfile' may be given to ZipRecover as an argument.

The supported options are

  -d
	Display the word frequency list to standard output.

  -f
	Generate a forward n-gram model only (by default, both a
	forward and a backward model are built).  This cuts the file
	size in half but degrades reconstruction.

  -F
	(deprecated) Set filter factor.  This flag is for backward
	compatibility, and merely multiplies the value set by -m.

  -m
	Set minimum frequency of occurrence for an n-gram to be
	included in the model (default = 1).

  -n
	Set maximum length of n-gram to be included in model (default
	6).  Languages with "small" alphabets in encodings where each
	character requires multiple bytes (e.g. Arabic or Hebrew in
	UTF-8 or Latin-alphabet languages in UTF-16) will benefit from
	increasing the maximum length to 8 or 10.

  -u
	Store unfiltered total n-gram counts in model.  By default,
	total counts exclude n-grams which were filtered out due to
	low frequency, which slightly alters the probabilities used in
	reconstruction.
